        // the problem with custom attributes is that HTML is a growing language and our non-standard attribute may one day become standard
        // therefore, all attributes starting with "data-" are reserved for programer's use
        // they are available in the "dataset" property
        // Ex:
        console.log(document.body.dataset.aboutThis);   // Multiword attributes like "about-this" become camelcased to "aboutThis"

        // so "data-*" is a safe way to pass custom data


        // Attributes are what's written in the HMTL
        // Properties are what's written in DOM objects
