        // Bubbling: when an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors
            // called bubbling because events bubble from the inner element up through the parents
            // almost all events bubble (focus event does not bubble)

        // in the html example, we get 3 logs to the console when we click on <p> element


        // a handler on a parent element can always get the details about where it actually happened
        // the most deeply nested element that caused the event is called the target element - event.target
            // "event.target" is the "target" element that initiated the event, it doesn't change through the bubbling process
            // "this" is the current element, the one that has a currently running handler on it

        // I think what happens is that with one click, we're clicking all 3 elements because they're nested
