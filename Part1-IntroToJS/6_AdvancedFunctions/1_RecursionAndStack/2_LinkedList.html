        // Linked List
            // a Recursive data structure

        // the issue with arrays is that shift and unshift are slow (adding or deleting from the beg of the array)
            // b/c we then need to renumber everything
            // so arrays are slow for big queues
        
        // linked list element is recursively defined as an object with:
            // value
            // next - property that referenced the next linked list element of null if it's the end

        let list = {
            value: 1,
            next: {
                value: 2,
                next: {
                    value: 3,
                    next: {
                        value: 4,
                        next: null
                    }

            }
        };

        console.log(list.next.next.value);

        // the list can easily be split into parts and later joined back:
        let secList = list.next.next;
        list.next.next = null;

        // join back:
        list.next.next = secList;

        // we can more quickly (in terms of efficiency) add to the beginning of a linked list than an array
        list = {
            value: "new item",
            next: list
        };

        console.log(list.value);

        // to remove a value form the middle
        list.next = list.next.next;

        console.log(list);

        // unlike arrays, there is no mass renumbering so it's quicker
        // downside to linked lists is we can't easily access an element by its number like an array (arr[n])

        // in a linked list, we could add "prev" in addition to "next" to reference the previous element and move back easily
            // the data structure can vary according to our needs
