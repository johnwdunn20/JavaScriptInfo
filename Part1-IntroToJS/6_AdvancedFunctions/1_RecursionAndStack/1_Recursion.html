        // taking light notes because I'm familiar with the concept of recursion 

        // recursion: when a function calls itself

        // x * x n times:
        function pow(x, n) {
            if (n == 1) return x;   // base of the recursion
            
            return x * pow(x, n-1);
        }

        console.log(pow(5, 5));

        // recusion deptch: how many nexted calls
        //the maximal number of nested calls (including the first one) depends on the engine byt we can rely on JS working up to 10,000 nested calls

        // iterative (aka loops) is usually more efficient
            // but efficiency doesn't always matter and sometimes recursion can be easier

        // Ex:
        // get the sum of salaries

        let company = {
            sales: [{
                name: 'John',
                salary: 1000
            }, {
                name: 'Alice',
                salary: 1600
            }],

            development: {
                sites: [{
                name: 'Peter',
                salary: 2000
                }, {
                name: 'Alex',
                salary: 1800
                }],

                internals: [{
                name: 'Jack',
                salary: 1300
                }]
            }
        };

        // maybe sites can be spit even further. Iterating over this is a challenge because the structure is not simple

        function sumSalaries(department) {
            if (Array.isArray(department)) { // if it's an array, we can get the sum of salaries
                return department.reduce((prev, current) => prev + current.salary, 0); // sum the array
            } else { // if not an array
                let sum = 0;
                for (let subdep of Object.values(department)) {
                sum += sumSalaries(subdep); // recursively call for subdepartments, sum the results
                }
                return sum;
            }
        }        



        // recursive  (also called recursively-defined) data structures replicate itself in parts
        // Ex: an html document may contain a list of:
            // text pieces
            // html-comments
            // other html tags (that then may have comments or text pieces or other tags)
