        // the Global Object provides variables and functions that are available anywhere, those that are built into the language

        // In a broswer, it's named "window"
        // In NodsJS, it's named "global"

        // "globalThis" is a standardized name too work in all environments (supported by all major broswers)
            // best option if your code may run in an environment other than a broswer

        // but we'll just use "window" in the below examples


        alert('Hello');
            // is the same as:
        window.alert('Hello');

        // global variables are not properties of the global object when declared with const / let
            // they are with "var" and that's another reason not to use that


        // to make a variable available globally (so all scripts can access it), write it directly as a property:
        window.currentUser = {name: 'John'};
            // not sure exactly how exactly other scripts can access it, maybe they need to be imported or something

        // either way, global variables are generally discouraged because they're confusing - weird if a variable comes from another script

        // to make our code future-proof and easier to understand, we should access properties of the global object directly, as "window.x"
