        // arrow functions are particularily useful when we don't want to leave the current context
        // arrow functions don't have their own "this"
            // if "this" is used, its taken from the outside

        // Ex where "this" is taken from the outside:

        let group = {
            title: 'Our group',
            students: ['John', 'Pete', 'Alice'],
            
            showList() {
                this.students.forEach(student => console.log(this.title + ': ' + student));
            }
        }

        group.showList();

        // in the above example, "this.title" is exactly the same as in the outer method showList because we use an arrow function
        // if we used a regular function, there would be an error because "this" would be undefined and undefined.title doesn't exist

        // arrow functions can't be run with "new" so can't be constructors so they can't be called with "new"

        // arrow functions also don't have the "arguements" variable

        // arrow functions don't have "super"
