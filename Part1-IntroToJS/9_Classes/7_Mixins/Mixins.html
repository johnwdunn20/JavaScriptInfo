        // JS can only inherit from one object
        // but we can use a "mixin" - a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without needing to inherit from it
            // so a mixin provides methods that implement a certain behavior but we don't use it alone - we use it to add the behavior to other classes

        // Mixin ex:

        let sayHiMixin = {
            sayHi() {
                console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`);
            },

            sayBye() {
                console.log(`Bye ${this.name}`);
            }
        }

        // mixin usage:
        class User {
            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
        }

        // copy the methods:
        Object.assign(User.prototype, sayHiMixin)
        
        // now user can say hi:
        new User('Dude').sayHi();

        // there is no inheritance but a simple method copying
        // so user could inherit from another class and also include the mixin methods


        // other languages support multiple inheritance but JS doesn't. So we use mixins
