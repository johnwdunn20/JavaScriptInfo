        // in object-oriented programming, properties and methods are split into 2 groups:
            // Insernal Interface - methods and properties accessible from other methods of the class but not from the outside
            // External Interface - methods and properties accessible from other methods of the class AND outside the class

        // In JS there are 2 types of object fields (properties and methods):
            // Public: accessible from anywhere (everything used up to this point)
            // Private: accessible only from inside the class; these are for the internal interface


        // ex:

        class CoffeeMachine {
            _waterAmount = 0;   // convention to begin protected properties with an underscore

            set waterAmount(value) {
                if (value < 0) {
                    value = 0
                }
                this._waterAmount = value;
            }

            get waterAmount() {
                return this._waterAmount;
            }

            constructor(power) {
                this._power = power;
                console.log(`Created a coffee-machine, power ${power}`);
            }

            get power() {           // making power read only
                return this._power
            }
        }

        let coffeeMachine = new CoffeeMachine(100);

        coffeeMachine.waterAmount = -200;

        console.log(coffeeMachine.waterAmount);     // waterAmout can't be below 0

        //   coffeeMachine.power = 25;
        // above line errors because we can't set power


        // Note: protexted fields are inheritable



        console.log('\n');
        // Private
            // Note - recent addition to JS so not supported in JS engines - need to be pollyfilled
            // private properties start with "#" and are only accessible from isnside the class
            // we could have private #waterAmount and public waterAmount - they are different
            // unlike protected fields, private fields are enforced by the language itself



        // in OOP, delimiting the internal interface from the external one is called encapsulation
