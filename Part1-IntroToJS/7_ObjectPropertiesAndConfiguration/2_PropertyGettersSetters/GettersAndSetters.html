        console.log(user.fullName);     // not calling as a function becasue no "()"

        // without a setter, we can't set fullName to a value outside the object

            // set - a function with one arguement that is called when the property is set
            // enumarable - same as for data properties

        // Using Accessor properties for compatibility
        // Accessor properties can allow us to take control over a regular data property ay any moment by replacing it with a getter and a setter and tweaking its behavior

        function Person(name, age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

            this.name = name;
            this.birthday = birthday;

            // age is calculated from the current date and birthday:
