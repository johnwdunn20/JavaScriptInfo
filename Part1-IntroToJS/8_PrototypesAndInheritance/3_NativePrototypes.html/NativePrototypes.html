        // "let obj = {}" is the same as "let obj = new Object()" and "Object" is built-in object constructor function with its own prototype referencing a huge object with toString and other methods
        // that's how we can do:
        let obj = {};
        document.write(obj);       // there exists a toString method in Object's prototype that lets us do this

        // when we call "obj.toString" the method is taken from Object.prototype


        // other built-in objects like Array, Date, Function, etc also keep methods in prototypes

        // the Chrome developer console shows the inheritance
        console.dir(obj);

        console.log(obj);


        // primitives are not objects but they can access their properties with prototypes (ie, Boolean.prototype, String.prototype, etc)


        // we can also modify native prototypes (Not recommended!!)
            // in modern programming, the only acceptable time to do this is for polyfilling aka making a substitute for a method that exists in the JS specification but is not yet supported by a particular JS engine
