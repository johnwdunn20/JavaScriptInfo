        // Internals

        // Arrays are just objects so they're copied by reference, just like an object
        // If we quit working with an array as an "ordered collection" and start working with it as an object, the array breaks
        // Arr[0] is essentially obj[key]
        // you could add an arbitrary key like Arr['You'] = 'John' but that would break the array and make it work like ab object


        // Performance
        // push/pop are fast and shift/unshift are slow 
            // b/c shift, for ex, require that the element is removed, then move every element to the left, then update the length property


        // for/in loops through the properties of an object
        // for/of loops through the properties of an iterable object
            // Arrays
            // also works with strings


        for (let x of 'hello') {
            console.log(x);
        }
        console.log('\n');

        // we could do this, but it's a bad idea
        for (let x in 'hello') {
            console.log(x);
        }

        // for in loop iterates over ALL properties, not just the numeric ones
            // issues when we work with "array-like" objects
        // for/in loop is optimized for generic objects, not arrays, so it's slower


        // we also could use "for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++)"


        console.log('\n');
        // length property
        // length is not the count of values in the array but the greatest numeric index + 1

        // seems like methods perform an action while properties are static
        // length doesn't perform an action because it's updated as the array is modified

        // the length property is also writable
            // if we increase it, nothing happens
            // but if we decrease it, then we can truncate our array
        // so to clear array
        let arr = ['John', 'Hannah'];
        arr.length = 0
        console.log(arr);


        console.log('\n');
        // Multidemensional Arrays
        let matrix = [
            [1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6],
            [7, 8, 9],
        ];

        console.log(matrix);

        // to get an element:
        console.log(matrix[1][1]);


        console.log('\n');
        // toString: Arrays have their own implementation of the toString method that returns a comma-seperated list of elements
            // num.toString() - used for numbers to strings
        let arr2 = [1, 2, 3];
        console.log(String(arr2));


        // Don't compare arrays with ==
        // b/c == treats them as objects and objects are only == equal if they're references of the same object
        
        // with Arrays, compare them side by side in a loop or use an iteration method
