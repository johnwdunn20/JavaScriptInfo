        // JS allows us to work with primitives as if they were objects - we can call methods
        // 7 primitive types (everything but object) (so Symbol is primitive)
        
        // primitives must be as fast and lightweight as possible
        // So in order to use methods on primitives, a special "object wrapper" that provides the extra functionality is created and then destroyed

        // Object wrappers are different for each primitive type and are called String, Number, Boolean, and Symbol and each provides a different set of methods

        let str = 'Hello';

        console.log(str.toUpperCase());

        // Here's what's actually happening:
            // 1. in the moment of accessing its property, a special object is created that knows the value of string and has methods
            // 2. the method runs (in this case returns a new string)
            // 3. The special object is destroyed, leaving the primitive "str" alone


        // Note: don't use constructors with String/Number/Bookean (possible only for historical reasons)

        // Null/Undefined don't have methods
