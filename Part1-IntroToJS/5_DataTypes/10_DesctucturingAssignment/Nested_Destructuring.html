        // Nested Destructuring
            // if an object or array contains other nested objects/arrays, we can extract them with more complicated left-side patterns
            // we make the pattern of the left sides of the assignment have the same structure as the object / array we are extracting from

        // Ex:
        let options = {
            size: {
                width: 100,
                height: 200,
            },
            items: ['Cake', 'Donut'],
            extra: true,
        }

        let {
            size: {
                width,
                height,
            },
            items: [item1, item2],
            title = 'Menu'  // default value b/c not present in our "options" object
        } = options;

        // console.log(size);   - this won't work because size isn't given a value. We take its contents instead
        console.log(height);
        // console.log(items); = won't work b/c items isn't given a value. We take its contents instead
        console.log(item1);
