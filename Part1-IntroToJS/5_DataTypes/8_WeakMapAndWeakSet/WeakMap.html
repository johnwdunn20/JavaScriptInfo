            // the object is still stored in memory
        // this isn't true in WeakMap
            // it will be removed, but you don't know when - has to do with JS Enginge's Garbage Collection system (I guess?)

        // WeakMap
            // keys must be objects

        // Use Cases:
            // Caching
            // Additional data storage - if working with an object that belongs to another code
