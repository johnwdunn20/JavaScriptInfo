            Potential solution 1
                - for every value in array, make it lower case and sort it alphabetically
                    - would need to make every arr value it's own array to sort the letters alphabetically
                - then I could make this a Map where the keys are the sorted letters and arr values are Map values
                    - this would get unique
                - then I return the Map values as an array
                - But there's probably an easier way to do this
