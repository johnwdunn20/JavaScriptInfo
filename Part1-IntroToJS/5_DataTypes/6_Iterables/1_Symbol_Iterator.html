        // iterable objects are a generalization of arrays - allow us to make any object usable in a for...of loop
        // if an object isn't technically an array, but represents a collection (list, set) of something, then for...of is a great way to loop over it
            // we can do this with strings
        
        // Ex:
        // is not an array, but we might want to loop over it:
        let range = {
            from: 1,
            to: 5,
        };

        // Symbol.iterator is a special built-in symbol
        // we add this method to the object to make it iterable
        // Steps:
            // when for..of starts, it calls that method (errors if not found)

        range[Symbol.iterator] = function() {

            // then for..on works only with that returned object
            
            return {
                current: this.from,
                last: this.to,

                    // when for..of wants the next value, it calls "next()" on that object
                next() {
                    if (this.current <= this.last) {    // so keep going untul current > last
                        return { done: false, value: this.current++};   // increment current by 1
                    } else {
                        return {done: true};
                    }
                    // the result of "next()" must have the form "{done: Boolean, value: any}" where done=true means the iteration is finished
                    
                }

            }
        };

        // now it works:
        for (let num of range) {
            console.log(num);
        }

        // the range object itself does not have the next() method
        // instead, another object, the "iterator" is created to call range[Symbol.iterator]() and it's "next()" generates values for the iteration

        // so the iterator object is seperate from the object it iterates over

        // if you create a range object where range goes to infinity, next() will just keep calling it so you'll need a break;



        // strings are already iterable so you don't need the Symbol.Iterator
