        // to see how this iterator works, we are going to iterate over a string using direct calls
            // I don't think we need to define Symbol.iterator's next() method like we did in the last example because it's already built in to the string type

        // we rarely do this in practice but would allow us to specify how we iterate if we'd like (van iterate some, then do something else, then go back to iterating)
