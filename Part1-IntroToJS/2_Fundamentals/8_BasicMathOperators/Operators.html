        // Operand is what the operators are applied to, ie 5 * 2 has 2 operands
        // an operator is unary if it has a single operand, ie x = -y
        // an operator is binary if it has 2 operands, ie 5 * 2
        // % - remainder
        // ** - exponents

        // if + operator is applied to strings, it concats them:
        let message = 'hello' + 'you';
        // if any operands are strings, it concats them
        let message2 = (1 + 2 + '3'); // 33, not 6 or 123 b/c 1+2 = 3 +'3' = 33
        console.log(message2)

        // operands other than + always convert the string to a Number
        console.log('5' - 2); // 3

        // + operator will convert non Numbers to numbers if there's only one operand. Ex:
        console.log(+true)
        console.log(+'7')

        // Operator precedence: unary operators are higher than their corresponding binary ones:
        let x = +'7' + +'1' // = 8

        // Chaining Assignments
        let a, b, c;
        a = b = c = 2 + 2;
        // all a, b, and c equal 4
        // expressions are evaluated from right to left

        // Modify in place +=, *= -=, and /=
        let n = 2;
        n *= 3 + 5; // =16

        // incrememnt and decrement
        n++;
        n--;
        // prefix vs postfix, ie ++n vs n++ :
        // this is kinda weird, google if needed

        //Bitwise operators - just know they exists, I can google them if need be

        // Commas: allow us to evaluate several expressions divided by a comma. All expresssions are evaluated, but only the last one is returned
        // Not commonly used, but sometimes in JS frameworks - if it comes up, google it
