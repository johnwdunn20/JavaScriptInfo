        "use strict";
        // create a variable with the "let" keyword:
        let message;
        // add data with assignment operator "="
        message = "Hello"; // storing this string
        // the string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable
        // we can access it with the variable name:
        alert(message);

        // can also combine variable declaration and assignment into a single line:
        let message2 = 'Hi';
        alert(message2);

        // we can also define variables like this:
        let user = 'John'
            , age = 27
            , state = 'Idaho';

        // older scripts use "var" instead of "let"

        // we can change the value of a variable
        message2 = 'yo';

        // Or copy data from one variable to another
        let message3 = message2;
        alert(message3);

        // variables can only contain letters, digits, $, or _ and the first character can't be a digit
        // these are valid:
        let $ = 1
            , _ = 2;

        // JS is case sensitive
        // can't use reserved words as variable names

        // when not in strict mode, you could declare a variable without "let" or "var" but it's bad practice

        // To declare a constant (unchanging variable) use "const"
        const myBirthday = '04.12.1993';
        // Attempting to resign a constant will cause an error

        // Best practice is to use all uppercase for constants that are variables known prior to execution
        // For example, orange hexadecimal value is always the same and is know before run time
        const COLOR_ORANGE = 'FF7F00';

        // But a constant like the time it takes the page to load isn't known before run time so we write it with normal camelCase
        const pageLoadTime = 1
