        // Nullish Coalescing operator
        // Note: This is a recent addition to JS so may not work in old broswers (might need pollyfills instead??)
        // For now, we'll say an expression is "defined" when it's neither null nor undefined

        // the nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks: ??
        // Ex: a ?? b -> if a is defined (not null or undefined), then a, if not, then b
        // ?? returns the first arguement that's not null/undefined
        // so
        let a, b, result;
        result = a ?? b;
        // is the same as:
        result = (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;
        // ?? is used to provide a default value for a potentially undefined variable (so it's just coalescing the)
        // ex:
        let user, friend;
        console.log(user ?? friend ?? 'unknown'); // unknown

        // but with the way || works, we could just use it instead in some cases
        // the difference is || returns the first truthy value and ?? returns the first defined value (ie, 0 or false is defined but not truthy)

        // If I need to use this, look up the precedence
        // can't use ?? with && or || unless you explicitly define it with parentheses
