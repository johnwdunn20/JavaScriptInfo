        // If you want to use JS in the most modern way, put "use strict" at the top of your code:
        "use strict";
        // Only comments can appear before it
        // "use strict" can also be put at the beginning of a function to enable strict mode for that function only
        // "use strict" was created so that older JS (with deprecated features) can still work normally
        // this allows JS to modify existing features

        // Moder JS supports classes and modules that enable "use strict" automatically so we don't need to add "use strict" when we use thim

        // strict mode makes it easier to write secure javascript (so you don't accidentlly use old JS)
