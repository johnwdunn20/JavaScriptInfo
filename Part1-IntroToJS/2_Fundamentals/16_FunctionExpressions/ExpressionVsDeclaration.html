        // Function Expressions start with "let x = function()"
        // Function Declarations start with "function x()"

        // Function Expressions are created when the execution reaches it and are usable from that moment
        // Function Declarations can be called earlier than they are defined

        // In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it's visible everywhere inside that block but not outside it
            // ie, declared inside an if statement or something similar
        // But Function Expressions are available outside the code block when declared inside the code block

        // Generally, it;s better to use Function Declarations
        // Use Function Expressions when Function Declarations aren't fit for the task
