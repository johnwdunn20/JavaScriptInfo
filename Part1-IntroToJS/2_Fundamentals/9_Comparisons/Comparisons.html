        // Boolean is the result of a comparison operator (>, <, <=, =>, !=, ==, ===, !==)

        // String comparison is lexicographical aka compared letter by letter
        // use unicode so lowercase comes before (aka has a greater index) than the letter's uppercase counterpart

        // when comparing different types, JS converts the values to numbers

        // == is equality and = is assignment
        // === is strict equality, compares value and type (so JS doesn't convert the values to numbers)
        console.log(0 == false) // true
        console.log('' == false) // true
        console.log(0 === false) // false
        // !=== is "strict non-equality" operator

        // undefined compared to anything is always false because undefined gets converted to NaN

        // Basically, just treat any comparison with null/undefined and not strict equality (===) carefully
