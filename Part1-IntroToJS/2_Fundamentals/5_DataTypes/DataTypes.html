        // whitespace doesn't matter in JavaScript
        // A variable can change data types which means JavaScript is "dynamically typed". Ex:
        let message = 'hello';
        message = 1234;

        // number type represents both integer and floating point numbers
        // Besides regular numbers, there are "special numerica values"
            // Infinity: can get it by dividing by 0 or by calling it directly:
            alert(1/0);
            alert(Infinity);

            //Nan: represents a computational error. Ex:
            alert('hi' / 5);
            // so mathematical errors in JS won't cause a fatal error, it will just return NaN

            // BigInt: for numbers that are bigger/smaller than +/- 2^53 -1
            // BigInt is created by appending "n" to the end of an integer

        // Single and double quotes are the same
        // Backticks are extended functionality quotes and allow us to embed variables/expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${...}
        let name = 'John'
        // embedding a variable:
        alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);

        // null: in JS, null is not a reference to a non-existing object or a null pointer; it represents nothing, empty, or value unknown
        let age = null;

        // undefined: means value is not assigned
        // if a variable is declared but not assigned, then its value is undefined
        let sister;
        alert(sister);
        // you could assign a value to undefined, but it's best to keep undefined for declared variables that don't have an initial value

        // Object type: used to store collections of data / more complex entities
        // other types are "primitive" because their values can only contain one single thing
        
        // symbol: used to create unique identifiers for objects

        // typeof operator: returns the type of the arguement
        // 2 formats: as an operator and as a function - both work the same and return a string with the type name
        //operator:
        typeof name;
        //function
        typeof(name);
        // typeof(null) will return "object" even though it's not really an object
