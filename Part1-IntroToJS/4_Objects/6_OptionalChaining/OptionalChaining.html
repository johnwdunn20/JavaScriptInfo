        // Note: this is a recent addition to the language
        // let's say we have a user with a non-existend property, address and street. It's okay that this user doesn't have these properies, but we don't want an error when we try and call them

        let user = {};

        // console.log(user.address.street)
        // this will erros because user.address is undefined so trying to get user.address.street will fail
        
        // we could use if statements or the conditional operator "?":
        console.log(user.address ? user.address.street : undefined);

        // Or we could do:
        console.log(user.address && user.address.street)

        // But Optional Chaining "?." is the easiest way to do this:
        // "?." stops the evaluation if the part to the LEFT of "?." is null or undefined

        console.log(user?.address?.street);

        // Note: Don't overuse the optional chaining - sometimes you'll want an error if a value doesn't exists so you know your code has an error

        // the value before "?." ("user" in this example) must be declared, even if it's null or undefined for Optional Chaining to not throw an error

        // Other Variants:
        // ?.() is used to call a method) that may not exists, ie:
        user.method?.() // calls 
        
        // ?.[] will also work if you want to use brackets to access a property instead of the dot, ie:
        // user?.[address]; // Note: this throws an error and I'm not sure why

        // works because "?." is not an operator but a special syntax construct

        // ?. can also be used with delete
        delete user?.name; // deletes user.name if user exists
