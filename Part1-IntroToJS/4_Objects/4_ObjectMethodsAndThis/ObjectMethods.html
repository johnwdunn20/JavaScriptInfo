        user.sayHi();

        // here we've used a Function Expression to create a fucntion and assign it to the property "user.sayHi" of the object
        // a function that is a property of an object is called a method

        // we can also a pre-declared function as a method:
        // declaring our function:
        function sayHello() {
            console.log('Hello!');
        };
        // then add as a method:
        user.sayHello = sayHello; // Note: no parentheses at the end of sayHello here (I think b/c we aren't calling the function, we;re assigning the function definition)

        user.sayHello();

        // writing code using objects to represent entities is object-oriented programming

        // But the quickest way to write a method in an object literal is:
        user2 = {
            sayHi() {       // could also do "sayHi: function ()"
                console.log('Hi');
            }
        }
