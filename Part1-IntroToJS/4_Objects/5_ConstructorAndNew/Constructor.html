        // Constructor functions and the "new" operator allow us to create any similar objects
        // Constructor functions are regular functions but convention says they are name with the first letter capitalized and they should be executed ONLY with the "new" operator
        function User(name) {   // this function is a constructor function and should only be used with new
            this.name = name;   // first "name" is the key, second is the parameter

        console.log(user1);

        // when a function is executed with new:
            // 1. a new empty object is created and assigned to "this"
            // 2. the function body executes - usually it modifies "this" / adds new properties to it
            // 3. the value of "this" is returned

        // the main purpose of constructors is to implement reusable object creation code

        let user2 = new User('Andrew');

        let user3 = new function() {
            this.name = 'Kenny';

        }
        // then the constructor can't be called again because it isn't saved anywerhere - it's just created and called
        // Realistically, would only be useful  if we're creating a single really complex object

        // Consturctors usually don't have return statements. If they do and return is called with an object, then that object is returned instead of 'this'. If return is called with a primitive, then it's ignored and 'this' is returned
        // Google this if I need it
