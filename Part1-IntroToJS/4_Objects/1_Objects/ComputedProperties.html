        // [fruit] means that the property name should be taken from from fruit

        // we can also use more complex expressions (ie, replace [fruit] with [fruit + 'computers'] as the value)

        // when properties (the key-value pair) have the same name as a variable, we can use a shorthand:
        function makeUser(name, age) {
            return {
                name, // same as name: name
                age, // same as age: age
                weight: 187,
            }
        };
        // Note: an object property can use a name that's a keyword but a variable can't
