        // This chapter just covers "plain objects" aka objects
        // But there are other types of objects (arrays, date, error, etc)
        // people will say "Array Type" but formally they are all of the object typez

        // there are 8 data types in JS, 7 are primitive
        // the 8th is objects

        // Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities
        // objects are created with {} with an optional list of properties aka a key-value pair

        // 2 syntaxes to create an object:
        let user1 = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
        let user2 = {}; // "object literal" syntax (usually this one is used)

        // we can put properties in an object:
        let user3 = {
            name: 'John'
            ,age: 27    // we could end each line with a comma (that works too) so I don't have to put the commas in front
            ,'likes snow': true
        };
        // keys are a string (but you don't put quotes around them unless the key is multiple words and has a space) and values can be any type

        // property values are accessible using the dot notation:
        console.log(user3.name); // John
        console.log(user3.age); // 27

        // to add a value:
        user3.isAdmin = true;

        // to remove a property:
        delete user3.age;

        // multi-word keys use square brackets and quotes
        user3['likes snow'] = false


        // an object declared as a constant can be changed
        const user4 = {
            name: 'John'
        };
        user4.name = 'Hannah';
        // const fixes the value of user, but not its contents
